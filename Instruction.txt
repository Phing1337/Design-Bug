# Figma Design Bug Reporter Plugin

## Core Functionality
1. When any frame(s) are selected and the plugin is open, allow bug report details to be added in the plugin UI.
2. On clicking "Create Bug", generate a new frame 56 pixels to the right of each selected frame.
3. Populate the new frame with the bug report details in a modern card style.

## Bug Report Fields
- Name
- Description
- Steps to recreate
- Expected behavior
- Actual behavior
- Priority
- Type
- Area

## UI/UX Requirements
- Include a "Create Bug" button
- Add a status message area for user feedback
- Include a "Copy Error" button for copying error messages to the clipboard

## Visual Design
Theme: Modern bug report card
Aesthetic qualities:
- Clean and minimalist design
- White background with subtle shadow
- Rounded corners
- Clear typography hierarchy

## Technical Considerations
- Font loading: Load required fonts (Inter Regular and Medium) before creating text nodes
- Error handling: Wrap main functionality in try-catch blocks
- Frame selection: Verify that frame(s) are selected before proceeding
- Default values: Provide default text for empty fields
- Styling: Apply modern card styling to the bug report frame

## Implementation Steps
1. Create UI (ui.html) with form fields and status/debug areas
2. Implement main plugin logic (code.js):
   a. Set up message handling between UI and plugin
   b. Implement frame selection validation
   c. Load required fonts
   d. Create and position new frame(s) next to the selected frame(s)
   e. Style the new frame(s) as modern cards
   f. Add styled text elements to the new frame(s)
   g. Handle errors and provide user feedback
3. Test with various scenarios and frame structures

## Future Enhancements (if needed)
- Add more bug report fields
- Implement custom color schemes
- Integrate with bug tracking systems
